        Hello, I am Maalik, A software engineer with 4+ years of experience
        building cutting edge user interfaces
      </p>
      <p>
        My passion for programming started at 18-years-old when I enrolled for a
        bootstrap course on udemy. I instantly struck a chord with design, user
        experience and intuitiveness of UI. Since then, I have never looked
        back.
      </p>
      <p>
        I went on to complete by bachelors degree in computer science from RYK
        College of Science and worked in various developer roles at startups
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, Iâ€™m a Senior Software Engineer @vesatogo, where I lead a team of
        front-end engineers working on a cutting edge tech stack comprising of
        ReactJS, NextJS, GraphQL, I am also comfortable with backend frameworks
        like Django and devops tech like Docker, AWS.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the core, I like to think of myself as a{' '}
        <strong>problem solver</strong> so tech stack becomes something
        secondary, I am always looking at ways to enchance my problem solving
        skills.
